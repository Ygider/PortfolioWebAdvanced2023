            <h1>Welcome to the Pokemon Team Maker</h1> 
            <p> Welcome, young trainer. <br>
                This is a tool for helping you generate a Pokémon team randomly. This team maker will generate 6 Pokémon from different regions and u have to chose one of them. Repeat until you got your team. <br>The goal is to find a new use for your Pokémon stored in your Pokémon Home. When was the last time you brought out your Pidgeot? Or your Nidoking? 
                <br>You will have a chance to bring out your most forgotten Pokémon thanks to our Pokémon team maker.
                Did the Pokémon team maker generate a Pokémon you don't have? <br>No problem. You can either remove it from the team and try again, or launch the Pokémon game to catch it and bring it to your Pokémon Home.<br>
                In what context can you use this randomly generated team? Challenge the Elite Four of the Pokémon game of your choice again with this team, or challenge your friends to generate their own teams using the Pokémon team maker and face your team.<br>
                I hope this tool will give a second life to some of your Pokémon.</p>
